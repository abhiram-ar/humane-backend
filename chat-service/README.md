### Why have converstion-room when for 1-1 conversation
- yes. for one to one converation we can lookup the recipient socket and directly write into it
- but we will have to implement the routering logic by ourself and we need to have seperate routing logic for group chat
- By keeing conversaion room consistant for 1-1 chat and group chat this approch is much more scalable and maintanable
